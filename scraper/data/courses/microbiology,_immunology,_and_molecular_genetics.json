From immortality to spraying acid, there are few otherworldly powers that nature has yet to develop in our fellow fauna. Investigation of sample of eight different groups of fascinating characteristics and some of peculiar animals that possess them, including humans. Exploration of the basic principles of evolution and several important aspects of conservation to better understand how such adaptations arise and many ways in which human activities put these \"magical\" organisms at risk. Through these analyses, students come to understand wider importance of protecting incredible diversity of life on our planet. P/NP grading. Facilitated by Cole Oost, with Oliver I.
