Conservation biology and genetics have had long and intimate relationship and constitute one key application of evolutionary analysis to real-world biological problems. Impacts of population genetics, phylogenetics, and phylogeography have been particularly striking for conservation biology and have helped solve some of most pressing problems in biological conservation. Annual workshop to provide training environment for small group of motivated graduate students to explore how conservation problems can best be addressed with genomic-level data. Hands-on experience on efficient collection, troubleshooting, and analysis of large datasets for conservation-relevant problems. Active participation from members of several U.S. government agencies at forefront of endangered species protection and management, providing forum for exploring relevant aspects of conservation genomics to managers.
